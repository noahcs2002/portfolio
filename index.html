                My name is Noah Sternberg, and I am (primarily) a backend software engineer for HCL Tech's UCD Launch team. If the
                questionable design of this website wasn't enough for you, I have minimal experience in web-dev, although I am learning more and more all the time.

                I was born in Evansville, Indiana, and moved a few years later to Paducah, Kentucky, where I spent my whole life, until I moved to 
                Murray, Kentucky for college. I attend Murray State University, where I am currently in my 4th and (barring a terrible series of events) final year
                as a Computer Science student for the MSU CSIS Department.

                In my free time, I like to read, play video games, and, as of lately, learn foreign languages. Currently I am learning Dutch with the hopes
                of one day visiting (and maybe immigrating to) The Netherlands. In the top left corner of the screen, you can navigate to my projects portfolio and 
                find my contact information, as well as a little information about the classes and educational content I've studied. Below is my resum√©.
