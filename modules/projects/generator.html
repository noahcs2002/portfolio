                I absolutely <em>despise</em> creating project skeletons and rough outlines. For one reason or another,
                I find it infuriating to deal with, and would rather do anything than that. 

                On the flip side of that coin, I <em>love</em> a good command line tool. It seemed to me
                like those two things were destined to meet, and so I made them meet, and produced a command
                line tool that generates project outlines and bare-bones projects for me.

                        I am a developer who likes to make a series of different projects. I prefer command line tools and 
                        API projects, but dabble in Java <em>swing</em> graphics, and I am also a student with fairly regular homework assignments.
                        That being said, this project allows me to generate project outlines in accordance to the way I do CLI projects, GUI projects, API projects, and homework assignments.

                        When considering how I wanted to make this happen, I opted to choose to allow multiple languages to be used
                        for several of the different product categories. I mainly develop in Java and Python, so I only included those two languages, 
                        but it would be easy enough to accomodate a new language.

                        In my eyes, the best command line tools are easy to use for someone who knows what they are doing,
                        and just as easy for someone to figure out if they don't know what's going on. In this command line tool,
                        if the user knows what's going on they have the option of running a <em>quick start</em> command instead of walking through
                        the command line procedure. For instance, if the user is familiar with the tool, they can run the command 
                        <code>java ProjectGenerator name="Demo Project" type=cl lang=java </code> to create a java command line project named Demo Project. In the image to the right,
                        I have the project tied to a script on my Mac.
