                In the fall of 2022, I took CSC325 - Advanced Object Oriented Programming. This class
                had an optional project: something big that covered lots of different concepts we had covered in class.
                The added bonus to the project? No final exam. So, I proposed my project, and got to work on it right away.
                The project I constructed was unnamed at first, but now is known as <em>Manage-Mint Express</em>. The goal
                was to, one day, expand upon the <em>Express</em> part and offer the project as more sophisticated service, but that
                is a long way off.
            </p>

            <p class="project-info">
                So what is <em>MME</em>? It is a light-weight fantasy/rookie league/little leage baseball team manager. It came with
                a mediocre but no-missing-pieces feature set, including all different forms of player statistics management.
                Pitchers had stats such as ERA, WAR, WHIP, SBA etc, while positon players could track things like put-outs, hitting average,
                as well as WAR. Eventually, the goal <em>was</em> to add a series of mathematical modeling features, as well as a trading feature,
                and a <em>"Game Day Mode"</em> to allow managers to trade players and schedule/record games.

                        This project used custom database files to construct (and remove once the user deleted their account) database tables.
                        The user would create an account if one did not exist which would prompt the custom DB engine to create the tables and
                        propogate with the necessary information. Then, when the user deleted their account or the team the account was under,
                        then the DB engine ran a clean-up operation to remove the tables to reduce clutter.

                        The goal with this project was to do as much from scratch as I could, so I wrote a custom tool to 
                        extract SQL code from a file and create a String representation of it, to serve as a query parameter.

                        I created a custom start up procedure for this project to run correctly. If the config file had
                        been written to with team information, then the user was deemed as "set up" and the program would start
                        right away. If the team information <em>hadn't</em> been written to the config file, then the 
                        startup information would be prompted for. This basically was a form of serialization before I learned how to
                        actually use <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> objects and such.

                        Commonly, databases need to be scaffolded. This is the process of constructing a database instance in such a way
                        that, once the database is started up, it comes already pre-equipped with certain tables and filler data, and already
                        has certain constraints imposed on it. Here I scaffolded the database to make sure that the <code>Teams</code> table was
                        already made and able to be used by the time the software was meant to be ran.
